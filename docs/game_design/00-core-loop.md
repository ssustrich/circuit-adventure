# Core Resource Loop – Circuit Adventure

### Overview
Circuit Adventure gamifies electronics and systems thinking.  
Players gather energy, components, and data to expand their workshop and build ever-smarter machines.

### Core Loop
1. **Harvest Energy**
   - Collect electrical energy from renewable nodes (solar pads, kinetic dynamos).
   - Store it in capacitors or batteries.
2. **Assemble Components**
   - Craft basic parts: resistors, LEDs, wires, sensors.
   - Unlock advanced ones: transistors, ICs, logic gates, processors.
3. **Connect Circuits**
   - Place components, wire them, and test functionality.
   - Success = energy flows, machines activate, data output increases.
4. **Refine & Expand**
   - Upgrade fabrication tools.
   - Combine circuits into subsystems (lighting, power, automation).
   - Automate resource collection → higher-tier tech.

### Feedback Loops
| Loop Type | Description | Reward |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| Energy ↔ Component | Using energy unlocks new materials; crafting consumes stored energy | Tech progression |
| Testing ↔ Learning | Experimenting gives “Data Fragments” | Unlocks blueprints |
| Maintenance ↔ Expansion | Circuits degrade; repairing teaches efficiency | Material bonuses |

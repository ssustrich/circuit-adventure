# Future Systems (Concept)

### Energy Ecology
- Different biomes produce unique power sources (solar desert, geothermal vent, hydro bay).
- Environmental modifiers change efficiency → encourages expansion.

### Automation Layer
- Circuit boards → Logic cores → Robotic arms → Factory lines.
- Introduce "Signal Bus" resource (binary data) separate from energy.

### Narrative Hooks
- Player restores an abandoned facility.
- Ancient AI requires circuits to reawaken.
- Each milestone triggers lore logs about lost engineers (“Founders”).

### Multiplayer / Co-op Vision
- Shared power grid between bases.
- Trade components, share blueprints.

### Educational / Creative Mode
- Realistic simulation mode toggled via settings (resistance, voltage drop, etc.).
- Integration with Steam Workshop or in-game blueprint sharing.

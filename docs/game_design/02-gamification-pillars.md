# Gamification Pillars

### 1. Discovery
- Players learn real electrical concepts through experimentation.
- Circuit validation and glowing feedback loop reinforce success.

### 2. Crafting & Ownership
- Components feel tangible: crafted, placed, and tested.
- Players label circuits, export blueprints, and trade designs.

### 3. Progression
- Multi-tier tech trees introduce new mechanics gradually.
- Higher tiers blend logic, automation, and resource management.

### 4. Autonomy
- Systems remain open-ended; players design their own circuit solutions.
- Sandbox + challenge modes coexist.

### 5. Feedback & Aesthetics
- Glowing lines, audible hums, and color shifts signal energy flow.
- Debug HUD and power graphs act as “visual reward loops.”

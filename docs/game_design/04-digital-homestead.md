# @codex — Core Theme: Digital Homestead / Circuit Colony

## 1. Core Theme

You’re not just wiring LEDs — you’re building a **self-sustaining circuit ecosystem.**  
Every node consumes, produces, or transforms resources: electrons, data packets, or abstract energy types.

| Concept | Analogy | Gameplay Mechanic |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Power** | electricity flow | manage generation, storage, and load balancing |
| **Signal** | logic pulses or bandwidth | optimize network latency or throughput |
| **Material** | raw metals, components | craft advanced parts using limited stock |
| **Heat / Noise** | system entropy | cool or filter to maintain efficiency |

The world behaves like a living board: current flows, data flickers, and entropy must be managed.

## 2. Resource Management Layer

### Production
- Generators, solar cells, kinetic harvesters.

### Consumption
- LEDs, machines, circuit modules.

### Storage
- Capacitors and batteries that slowly degrade over time.

### Transport
- Wires, data buses, or relays with efficiency trade-offs (resistance, signal loss).

### Upkeep
- Periodic repair of worn connectors or upgrades for higher throughput.

**Gameplay loop example**

> Gather raw silicon → refine into chips → assemble logic cores → build smarter automation that harvests more efficiently.

## 3. Logistics & Automation Loop

Once multiple items can be crafted, introduce **routing problems**:

- Items travel along conveyor traces or data busses.
- Players program simple routing logic:  
  *“Send power to Cluster A if charge < 50%.”*
- Modular factories:
  - Machine A → diodes  
  - Machine B → wires  
  - Machine C → circuit boards  

> Think *Factorio* or *Satisfactory*, but set **inside a virtual circuit board.**

## 4. Crafting & Tech Tree

| Tier | Unlocks |
|------|----------|
| **1. Basic Electrical** | wire, LED, battery |
| **2. Logic Gates** | AND/OR/NOT modules, automation triggers |
| **3. Microcontrollers** | programmable circuits, timed logic |
| **4. Fabrication** | smelters, assemblers, crafting machines |
| **5. Nanocircuitry** | self-replicating systems, quantum bits |

Gate progression with rare resources or research discoveries:  
*“Invent Boolean Logic,” “Develop Integrated Circuits.”*

## 5. Survival & Maintenance Hooks

Introduce light survival tension:

- Power outages drain stored charge — rebuild before blackout.  
- Circuits overheat → require coolant modules.  
- Corrosion or shorts degrade connectors over time.  
- Environmental events (cosmic rays, EMP bursts) force adaptation.

This pushes the player to **maintain and improve infrastructure**, not just scale linearly.

---

## 6. Macro Economy / Story Layer

Give the player larger purpose beyond construction:

- **Contracts:** deliver energy quotas or manufactured components to clients.  
- **Colonization:** power multiple remote “bases” or AI cores connected by datalines.  
- **Trade:** optimize production lines for export, buy rare alloys or data.  
- **Narrative:** you’re an AI awakening in a decaying mainframe, rebuilding itself one component at a time.

---

## 7. Visual & UX Inspiration

- **In-world UI:** holographic circuit schematics and glowing traces.  
- **Power visualization:** current flow brightens active paths.  
- **Resource HUD:** “logic scope” overlay showing throughput and efficiency.  
- **Automation tools:** draggable logic nodes — visual scripting inside the game world.

## 8. Example Playable Loop (Prototype)

1. Place a **PowerSource** (generates limited current).  
2. Connect via wires to **LEDs** (consume current).  
3. Build a **Battery** to store excess charge.  
4. Add a **Crafting Node** that uses energy + materials to produce parts.  
5. Unlock **Signal Nodes** to automate power toggling for efficiency.  
6. Scale up to maintain **multiple grids** without overload.

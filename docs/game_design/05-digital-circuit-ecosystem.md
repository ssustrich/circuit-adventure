# @codex — Core Resource Loop: The Digital Circuit Ecosystem

## 1. High-Level Concept

The world functions as a **self-contained digital biosphere.**  
Every entity — LED, wire, generator, or fabricator — **consumes, transforms, or produces** signal, energy, and matter.  
Your goal: design sustainable feedback loops that prevent overload or scarcity.

## 2. Core Resources

| Resource | Source | Sink / Usage | Description |
|-----------|---------|--------------|--------------|
| **Energy** | PowerSource, SolarCell | LEDs, Machines | Represents electrical power or “charge.” Flows via wires and batteries. |
| **Signal** | LogicCore, Sensors | Switches, Actuators | Data pulses controlling automation — the logic layer of the world. |
| **Matter** | Extractor, Recycler | Fabricators | Raw material for crafting; recycled from spent parts. |
| **Heat / Entropy (emergent)** | All devices | Coolers, HeatSinks | Optional later layer; accumulates from inefficiency and overuse. |

Each resource forms part of a dynamic equilibrium:  
**Energy and Matter power creation**, **Signal coordinates behavior**, and **Heat penalizes inefficiency.**

## 3. Loop Flow (Tier 1 → Tier 3)

### ⚡ Generate → Store → Distribute → Consume
- PowerSource feeds the circuit grid.  
- Battery stores overflow.  
- LEDs and machines draw energy.

### 🛠 Use Energy + Matter → Craft Components
- CraftBench converts base Matter + Energy into Wires, LEDs, and modules.

### 🔁 Expand Grid → Automate Control
- Add Switches & Logic Gates to regulate flow (**Signal** resource).  
- Prevent overloads and shortages via logic.

### ♻ Reclaim Waste → Sustain Loop
- Recycler converts burnt parts or used Matter back into raw input.

> The loop balances **Energy** and **Matter** while optimizing **Signal** efficiency.  
> Later tiers add Heat recovery, Data optimization, and new transformation mechanics.

## 4. Tier 1 Tech Tree – Foundation of Circuits

| Unlock | Prerequisites | Requires | Function | Gameplay Role |
|---------|----------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Wire** | None | Matter | Connects two nodes | Enables power flow |
| **Power Source** | None | Matter + Energy Seed | Generates base Energy | Starting node |
| **LED** | Power Source + Wire | Matter + Energy | Visual consumer; confirms flow | Basic test component |
| **Battery** | Power Source | Matter × 2 + Energy | Stores Energy; smooths peaks | Stability & buffering |
| **Switch** | Wire + Energy | Matter + Signal | Allows toggling flow | Manual control |
| **Resistor** | Wire | Matter + Signal | Reduces current intensity | Efficiency tuning |
| **CraftBench** | Battery | Matter + Energy | Combines Matter into components | Introduces crafting loop |
| **Sensor** | Switch | Matter + Signal | Converts environment → Signal | Foundation for automation |
| **Logic Gate (AND/OR)** | Sensor + Signal | Matter + Signal | Combines control inputs | Automates circuits |

## 5. Tier 1 Progression Loop

1. Craft **Wires** → link **Power Source → LED** → see light (proof of flow).  
2. Add a **Switch** → control LED manually.  
3. Build a **Battery** → stabilize power supply.  
4. Use **CraftBench** → produce more components (Switches, Sensors).  
5. Unlock **Logic Gates** → begin automation.

**Tier 1 Goal:**  
Create a self-sustaining, manually controllable energy grid that powers simple automated outputs.

## 6. Expansion Hooks (by Tier)

| Tier | Theme | New Systems |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **2 – Automation** | Timers, Repeaters, Relays | Distribution Nodes, load balancing |
| **3 – Manufacturing** | Fabricators, Smelters | Heat management, Alloyed components |
| **4 – Networks** | Data Lines, Microchips | AI Control Units, global signal routing |
| **5 – Quantum** | Nano-circuits | Self-repairing systems, dimensional routing |

Each tier adds **new transformations** and resource dependencies while preserving the same core balance loop:  
**Energy ↔ Matter ↔ Signal**, constrained by **Entropy**.
